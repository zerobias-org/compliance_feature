CrowdStrike provides a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC) for its customers. The CrowdStrike Falcon Applicability for PCI DSS v4.0 report shows how the features of the Falcon Platform map to specific requirements in the PCI DSS framework, and how these features can be leveraged for PCI DSS compliance (https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/crowdstrike-falcon-and-pci-dss-compliance/, https://trust.crowdstrike.com/?itemUid=3815d86e-16b4-411c-a617-119aa81e5f23&source=title).
